Russell  - event de-dup, hql/sql, top k spenders by app

For an easy question, I had him walk me through how to guarantee that events are de-duplicated (this ended up including a HQL/SQL question because of the approach he chose).  For the tougher question, I had him design and start to implement the top K spenders by app program.  He used Storm.

Vivek - team overview - technologie / framework understanding
talked about kafka, flume, scribe, storm - had good understanding
scribe - talked about log collection
flume - for transport log to kafka, file based buffer in the source. using it to use kafka as channel for push model from kafka
kafka - file based queue, topics, partitions in topic for throughput
storm - talked about how he used for business  trends (pageviews / other in real time), used redis for caching, used grouping feature of storm do some in memory caching in bolt. 
  - Did not ask about persistent store used after storm and how he is aggregating.
Install cohort retention - data model - i asked about this. He did not know much about it. Also we ran out of time.

Charlie - likely etl / pipeline workflow

Brian Hansen -
 - Java or any language programming question
 - Stretch - ETL Testing  questions - how to test using smaller data ? 
 - Debugging etl
